This is a little tool to make my work with a local library easier.

You can search in the searchbar with suggestions of library 1
and search for book titles in a library 2 with percentage of matching titles.
then decide if the titles match and mark them as "double" or "to scan" for digitalisation purpose.

the results will be saved in the local storage of your browser.
Additionaly you can save and reload a backup file of the work done so far.
